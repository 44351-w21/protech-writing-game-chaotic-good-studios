### Intro
* 2-5 players
* Avg. gameplay 30-60 minutes
* Goal: become the first to graduate

### Set-Up Instructions
* Choose your player: Jock, Prep, Loner, Rebel, Nerd
* When all players are ready press start
  * Oldest player goes first (I think this should be changed, maybe randomized?)
### Gameplay
* Roll the "die" and you will be moved the number of spaces indicated.
  * You will land on one of six possible spaces: History, English, Math, Science, Detention, or Exam Day. 
* If you land on:
  * History, English, Math, or Science: the player to your right will draw a trivia card that corresponds to the space youâ€™ve landed on.
  * Detention: you will not draw a trivia card, and your turn is over.
  *  Exam Day: choose one of the four subject decks. The player to your right will draw a trivia card from that deck.
* When answering a trivia question, the player to your right will read the card for you. Attempt to answer the question. ( We can just have a randomized question)
  * If you answer correctly: collect the card. The card will count as one credit.
  * If you answer incorrectly: the answer will not be revealed, and the card will be returned to the bottom of the deck. You collect zero credits. 
* Repeat steps 1-3 until any player obtains eight credit hours.
  * This player is the first to graduate, and wins the game.
