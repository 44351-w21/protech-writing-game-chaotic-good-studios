### Introduction
* 2-5 players
* Avg. gameplay 30-60 minutes
* **Goal:** Become the first to graduate

### Set-Up Instructions
* **Choose your player:** Jock, Prep, Loner, Rebel, Nerd
* When all players are ready press start
  * Oldest player goes first. *(I think this should be changed, maybe randomized?)*
### Gameplay
* Roll the "die" and you will be moved the number of spaces indicated.
  * **_You will land on one of six possible spaces:_** *History, English, Math, Science, Detention, or Exam Day*.
* If you land on:
  * **History, English, Math, or Science:** The player to your **_right_** will draw a trivia card that corresponds to the space youâ€™ve landed on.
  * **Detention:** You will not draw a trivia card, and your turn is over.
  * **Exam Day:** Choose one of the four subject decks. The player to your **_right_** will draw a trivia card from that deck.
* When answering a trivia question, the player to your **_right_** will read the card for you. Attempt to answer the question. *(We can just have a randomized question)*
  * **If you answer _correctly_:** Collect the card. The card will count as one credit.
  * **If you answer _incorrectly_:** The answer will not be revealed, and the card will be returned to the bottom of the deck. You collect zero credits.
* Repeat steps 1-3 until any player obtains eight credit hours.
  * This player is the first to graduate, and wins the game.
